I am a senior Research Scientist at [Mitsubishi Electric](https://www.mitsubishielectric.com/en/index.html). My research focuses on robotics and reinforcement learning. My work spans the robotics, machine learning, and computer vision communities.

I received my PhD from [Tokyo Institute of Technology Automation & Knoledge Laboratory](https://www.ak.c.titech.ac.jp//index-eng.html) under supervision of Prof. [Asako Kanezaki](https://kanezaki.github.io/). I received my M.S. and B.S. in Aerospace Engineering from [Tokyo Institute of Technology Laboratory for Space Systems](http://www.lss.mech.e.titech.ac.jp/web_matunaga_lab/index_e/) under supervision of Prof. Saburo Matsunaga.
